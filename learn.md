# Plateful

## LEARN ABOUT Plateful

Plateful is a food waste reduction app that connects restaurants with customers to sell leftover food at discounted prices.

## Architecture

Plateful follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, which separates the presentation layer from the business logic and data handling. This architecture pattern helps to create a modular, scalable, and testable codebase.
