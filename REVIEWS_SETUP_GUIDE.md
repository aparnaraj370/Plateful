# 🌟 Reviews & Rating System Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start Instructions

### 1. Deploy Firestore Security Rules

To fix the indexing issues and enable the reviews feature, follow these steps:

#### Option A: Firebase Console (Recommended)
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your `plateful-abin` project
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database** → **Rules**
4. Replace the existing rules with the updated rules from `firestore.rules` file
5. Click **Publish**

#### Option B: Firebase CLI
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI if not already installed
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Navigate to your project directory
cd F:\Plateful

# Deploy the rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 2. Create Firestore Indexes (IMPORTANT!)

The indexing error occurs because compound queries need indexes. Create these indexes:

#### Method 1: Automatic Index Creation (Easiest)
1. Run the app and try to view reviews
2. Check the Android Studio Logcat for the error message
3. The error will contain a direct link to create the index
4. Click the link and it will automatically create the required index

#### Method 2: Manual Index Creation
Go to Firebase Console → Firestore → Indexes → Composite and create these indexes:

**Index 1: Restaurant Reviews**
- Collection ID: `reviews`
- Fields to index:
  - `restaurantId` (Ascending)
  - `timestamp` (Descending)

**Index 2: Menu Item Reviews**  
- Collection ID: `reviews`
- Fields to index:
  - `restaurantId` (Ascending)
  - `menuItemId` (Ascending) 
  - `timestamp` (Descending)

**Index 3: User Reviews**
- Collection ID: `reviews`
- Fields to index:
  - `userId` (Ascending)
  - `timestamp` (Descending)

### 3. Test the Reviews Feature

The app now includes **mock data fallback**, so even if Firebase queries fail, you'll still see sample reviews for testing.

## 📱 How to Use the Reviews Feature

### For Users:

#### 1. **View Reviews**
- Open any restaurant from the main screen
- Go to **Restaurant Profile** → **Reviews** tab

- Tap the **floating action button (➕)** or **"Write Review"**
- Rate using the interactive star system (1-5 stars)
- Write your review text
- Submit the review

#### 3. **Filter & Sort Reviews**
- Use filter chips: All, 5-star, 4-star, etc.
- Sort by: Most Recent, Highest Rating, Most Helpful
- Filter by photos or verified purchases

#### 4. **Interact with Reviews**
- Tap **"Helpful"** button to mark reviews as useful
- Report inappropriate reviews
- View restaurant responses to reviews

### For Restaurant Owners:

#### 1. **View Analytics**
- See average ratings and review distribution
- Monitor recent customer feedback
- Track review trends over time

#### 2. **Respond to Reviews** (Future Feature)
- Reply to customer reviews
- Address concerns publicly
- Thank customers for positive feedback

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Components Overview:
```
📁 reviews/
├── 📄 Review.kt                 # Data models
├── 📄 ReviewRepository.kt       # Firebase operations  
├── 📄 ReviewViewModel.kt        # Business logic
├── 📄 AddReviewScreen.kt        # Add review UI
├── 📄 ReviewsListScreen.kt      # Browse reviews UI
└── 📁 components/
    └── 📄 ReviewComponents.kt   # Reusable UI components
```

### Data Flow:
1. **Repository** → Handles Firebase Firestore operations
2. **ViewModel** → Manages state and business logic  
3. **UI Screens** → Displays data and handles user interactions
4. **Components** → Reusable UI elements (stars, cards, etc.)

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Mock Data (Development)
The system automatically falls back to mock data when:
- Firebase is not configured
- Network issues occur
- No real reviews exist yet

To disable mock data:
```kotlin
// In ReviewRepository.kt, remove the fallback logic
return Result.success(emptyList()) // Instead of getMockReviews()
```

### Real-time Updates
Reviews update in real-time when:
- New reviews are submitted
- Reviews are marked as helpful
- Restaurant responses are added

### Performance Optimization
- **Pagination**: Loads reviews in batches of 20
- **Caching**: Stores reviews locally for offline viewing
- **Memory Sorting**: Sorts in-memory to avoid index requirements

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. "The query requires an index" Error
**Solution**: Create the Firestore indexes as described above

#### 2. "Permission denied" Error
**Solution**: Ensure Firestore rules are deployed correctly

#### 3. No reviews showing
**Solution**: 
- Check internet connection
- Verify Firebase project configuration
- Check if mock data fallback is working

#### 4. Cannot submit reviews
**Solution**:
- Ensure user is authenticated
- Check Firestore write permissions
- Verify form validation (rating must be > 0)

### Debug Steps:
1. Check Android Studio Logcat for detailed error messages
2. Verify Firebase project connection in `google-services.json`
3. Test with mock data first (should work offline)
4. Gradually enable Firebase features

## 🎯 Testing Scenarios

### Test Cases:
1. **View restaurant reviews** ✅
